DESCRIPTION                                                 *gendoc-description*

Writing vim plugins is a lot of work. Which is mostly fun work. Except for the
documetation of course. And it's made worse by the fact that there is no such
thing like generating api docs from sourcecode comments. Or that you have to
write a README.md for github, but also a separate incompattible helpfile for
inside vim.

This plugin intends to change this by allowing you to write API documentation
right in vimscript where you define the public commands and functions etc, and
then use templating to inject it in a helpfile. Or allow you to use templating
to write once, and inject in multiple sources.
